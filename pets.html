        <p>Rocky is a 17 year old cat who enjoys spending his time laying around. He likes watching birds and trying to talk to them. 
            While he loves birds from afar, he is not a fan of any other animals and enjoys terrorizing the dog, Oliver.</p>
        <p>Rocky is also a big fan of eating. He will do anything for a treat and likes any and all foods. 
                He will gladly sneak onto the dinner table to sample any and all foods. If he does not enjoy eating the food, 
                Rocky is fine with playing with it instead.

        <p>Pumpkin is an 11 year old cat. He loves eating. Even when he is full, he will continue to eat if it means
            the dog will not get any. Pumpkin also grealy enjoys napping. Half his day is spent asleep and the other half
            is spent begging for food.</p>
            <p>Pumpkin is a very smart cat. He can sense when people are allergic to him so naturally, he 
                gravitates towards them. He also loves antagonizing Oliver, the dog. However, he does not enjoy 
                when Oliver barks.</p>

        <img src="Images/oliver.jpg" alt="Dog laying on floor." width="400">
        <br>
        <p>Oliver is very focused on two things: eating and getting attention. He is devestated
            when his owner leaves him. Whether she leaves for the day to go to work or for two minutes
            to brush her teeth, it all feels like an eternity to him.</p>
            <p>The only circumstance in which Oliver will leave his owner is when food is involved. Oliver is not
                very brave but he is able to muster up a lot of courage when a treat is involved. He cowered away
                from a kitten until he noticed she had a full bowl of food.</p>

    <img src="Images/happy_sleep.jpg" alt="Black and grey cat laying on bed, near asleep" width="400">
    <br>
    <p> Happy is an old cat. He spends a lot of his day lounging around, in whatever spot he feels is most comfortable at the time. 
        He is an indoor cat, but whenever we open the door to let the dogs out, he always comes running out so he can eat grass.
    </p>
        <p>Happy is pretty friendly with one of my dogs, Katie. They do not interact much, but when they do, it is usually just friendly sniffs. 
            My other dog, Izzy, however, loves biting at Happy. 
            Happy usually will just run away, but sometimes he will retalliate by giving Izzy a smack! It is all in good fun though.

    <p> Molly is an 18 year old calico cat. She prefers spending her days lounging on the couch or curled up sleeping over a vent (or anything warm).
         Occasionally, she will go outside and attempt to hunt birds or rats (sometimes successful which is terrifying).</p>
        <p>Her favorite habit is to brush against our legs, especially during dinner when everyone is seated around a table. 
            She is an attention seeker, always meowing to get as many pets and head rubs as she possibly can.</p>

        <p>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. 
            However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>
